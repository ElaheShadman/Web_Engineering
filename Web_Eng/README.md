# Web_Engineering
🌐 Web Engineering – First Year Student Project
📌 About This Repository
This repository contains my exercises, projects, and learning notes from my first year studying Web Engineering.
My goal is to build a solid foundation in how modern websites and web applications work — from basic HTML structure to interactive features and backend logic.

🧩 What I’m Learning
As a first‑year student, I’m focusing on:

Frontend Basics
HTML for structure

JavaScript for simple interactivity

Backend Fundamentals
Understanding how servers work

Basic request/response handling

Introduction to APIs

Tools & Workflow
Git & GitHub for version control

VS Code as my main editor

Browser DevTools for debugging

🎯 Goals of This Repository
Track my progress throughout the semester

Practice clean and organized code

Build small web projects to apply what I learn

Improve step by step and document my journey
